**Explanation of the Typing SVG Code:**

The key part is this line:
`<img src="https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&weight=600&size=25&pause=1000&color=F7F7F7&center=true&vCenter=true&width=430&lines=Hi%2C+I'm+Sridhar+K+S!;Business%2FMarketing+Analyst;Management+Graduate;Passionate+about+Data+Analysis" alt="Typing SVG" />`

Let's break down the parameters in the URL:

* `font=Fira+Code`: Sets the font. You can change this to other common web-safe fonts (e.g., `Arial`, `Roboto`, `Open+Sans`). Use `+` for spaces.
* `weight=600`: Font weight (e.g., 400 for regular, 700 for bold).
* `size=25`: Font size in pixels.
* `pause=1000`: How long to pause at the end of each line (in milliseconds, 1000ms = 1 second).
* `color=F7F7F7`: Text color in hexadecimal. You can change this to suit your preference (e.g., `000000` for black, `FF0000` for red).
* `center=true&vCenter=true`: Centers the text horizontally and vertically within the SVG.
* `width=430`: Width of the SVG image. You might need to adjust this based on the length of your longest line.
* `lines=Hi%2C+I'm+Sridhar+K+S!;Business%2FMarketing+Analyst;Management+Graduate;Passionate+about+Data+Analysis`: This is the most important part!
    * Each phrase you want to display is separated by a semicolon (`;`).
    * Spaces should be replaced with `+`.
    * Special characters like commas (`,`) are URL-encoded as `%2C`. You can use an online URL encoder if you want to include other special characters.

**To customize the text:**

Just modify the `lines=` parameter in the URL. For example, if you wanted to add "Your Next Hire!", you'd change it to:
`lines=Hi%2C+I'm+Sridhar+K+S!;Business%2FMarketing+Analyst;Management+Graduate;Passionate+about+Data+Analysis;Your+Next+Hire!`

**Action for you:**

1.  **Copy the updated full `README.md` content** above.
2.  **Paste it into your `README.md` file** in your GitHub profile repository (the one named `SridharKS023`).
3.  **Remember to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`** with `SridharKS023` in the GitHub Stats section.
4.  **Commit your changes.**

You should then see the animated typing effect on your GitHub profile! Let me know if you'd like to try different phrases or adjust any of the other parameters.
